## About this project

This project is the first (and might be the only) implementation of TaiDoKu in Go.  It provides the basic methods as a golang library including:

* Program and tile handling
* OP Lookup
* Execution
* Refinement

and a few utilties for this language, hopefully:

* Interpreter
* Wrapper for animation
* Visual debugger
* Program miner (you known, itis very hard to program in such esolang)
* COMPILER
* etc.
